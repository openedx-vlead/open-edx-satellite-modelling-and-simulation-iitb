<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> In classical physics, it has been observed that when a signal wave is generated from a source which has a relative motion with the observer then there is a change in wavelength or frequency of the signal wave. The above can be well related to a scene where you are standing along the roadside and a speeding car passes in front of you. When the car is moving towards you, you can easily figure out an increase in frequency making it highly pitched and as it goes away from you, the observed frequency is reduced.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">As we have seen that the relative motion of the source and observer is the fundamental cause for the change in wavelength and hence the frequency of the original signal wave generated from the source. When the relative distance between the source and the observer decreases, each successive wave crest is transmitted from the position which is more closer to the observer. Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an decrease in the wavelength ad increase in the frequency. This particularly can happen when the source is moving towards the observer or the observer is moving towards from the source.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN">Similarly, when the relative distance between the source ans the observer increases, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave. So the arrival time between successive waves is increased, increasing the wavelength and reducing the frequency. This can be the case when the source is moving away from the observer or the observer is moving away from the source.</span></p>
